# InstaloaderSharp manual

Welcome to the InstaloaderSharp manual. InstaloaderSharp is a free command-line program for Windows that downloads pictures and videos from Instagram, along with their captions and other metadata: whole profiles, single posts, hashtags, locations, your feed, your saved posts, stories, highlights and reels. It is a C# / .NET Framework version of [Instaloader](https://github.com/instaloader/instaloader), with the same command line and file formats, so the two programs can work on the same downloads.

No previous knowledge of Instaloader is needed. If you are new, start with [Getting started](Getting-started), then read [Targets](Targets) and [Logging in](Logging-in). If you prefer a graphical user interface, have a look at [InstaloaderSharp GUI](https://github.com/InstaloaderSharp/InstaloaderSharpGUI).

## Conventions in this manual

- Commands are shown as they are typed in a Windows command prompt (`cmd.exe`), with the program named `InstaloaderSharp.exe`. If you renamed it, for example to `instaloader.exe`, use that name instead.
- `YOUR-USERNAME` stands for your Instagram username, `profilename` for the username of the profile you want to download.
- Options are shown in their long form (`--fast-update`); the short form, where there is one, is given in brackets (`-F`).
- Times in file names are in UTC unless the text says otherwise.
