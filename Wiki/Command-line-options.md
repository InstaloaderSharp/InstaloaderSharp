## Synopsis

```
InstaloaderSharp.exe [options] target [target ...]
InstaloaderSharp.exe [options] -- -SHORTCODE [...]
InstaloaderSharp.exe +args.txt
InstaloaderSharp.exe --help
```

Targets are described in [Targets](Targets). Without targets, the program only logs in (if asked to) and prints `No targets were specified, thus nothing has been downloaded.`

## How the command line is read

The command line is read like Instaloader's (Python's `argparse`):

- **Options come before targets**, but they may also be mixed with them: `InstaloaderSharp.exe profile1 --stories profile2` works.
- **Values** follow the option, separated by a space or `=`: `--count 50` and `--count=50` are the same.
- **Abbreviations:** long options can be shortened as long as they stay unique: `--fast` for `--fast-update`, `--no-vid` is ambiguous (`--no-videos` or `--no-video-thumbnails`) and gives an error.
- **Short options** can be combined: `-sF` is `-s -F`. A value can follow directly: `-c50`.
- **`--`** ends the options: everything after it is a target, even if it starts with `-`. This is how single posts (`-- -SHORTCODE`) are given.
- **Optional values:** `--latest-stamps` takes an optional file name. A target right after it would be taken as the file name, so write `--latest-stamps -- profilename`, or put another option in between.
- **Quoting:** values with spaces, and hashtags, must be quoted: `--dirname-pattern "D:\My Instagram\{target}"`, `"#cats"`.

Errors in the command line are reported with a short usage text, and the program exits with code 2:

```
usage: InstaloaderSharp [--comments] [--geotags] ...
InstaloaderSharp: error: unrecognized arguments: --foo
```

## Reading options from a file

Arguments can be put into a text file and passed with `+` in front of its name:

```
InstaloaderSharp.exe +args.txt
```

The file contains one argument per line: options with their values joined by `=`, and targets:

```
--login=YOUR-USERNAME
--fast-update
--stories
--post-filter=not is_video
profile1
profile2
```

- Each line is exactly one argument, so do not quote values, and write `--count=50` rather than `--count 50`.
- Empty lines and comments are not allowed; every line counts as an argument.
- Files and normal arguments can be mixed, and several files can be given: `InstaloaderSharp.exe --quiet +login.txt +profiles.txt`.
- The file is read as UTF-8 text; a file that is not valid UTF-8 is read in the Windows code page instead.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Finished, but some errors occurred. They were printed when they happened and are repeated at the end under `Errors or warnings occurred:` |
| `2` | Invalid command line or option values, or an invalid filter |
| `3` | Login failed |
| `4` | Download aborted: Instagram demanded a verification, or a status code from `--abort-on` was received |
| `5` | Interrupted by the user (Ctrl+C) |
| `99` | Unexpected error; a technical error report (traceback) is printed. Please [report it](Building-and-contributing#reporting-bugs) |

In a batch file, the exit code is in `%errorlevel%`:

```bat
InstaloaderSharp.exe --quiet --login YOUR-USERNAME --fast-update +profiles.txt
if %errorlevel% equ 3 echo Log in again: the session has expired or the login failed.
if %errorlevel% equ 4 echo Instagram stopped the download; check the account in a browser.
```

`if errorlevel N` is true for all codes of N and above, so prefer `if %errorlevel% equ N` to test for one code.
