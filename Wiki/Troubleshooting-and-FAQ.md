## Installation and start-up

**Nothing happens when I double-click `InstaloaderSharp.exe`, or a window flashes and closes.**
InstaloaderSharp is a command-line program. Open a command prompt and run it there; see [Getting started](Getting-started#your-first-download).

**Windows says that .NET Framework 4.8.1 is missing.**
Install .NET Framework 4.8.1 from Microsoft. It is a free runtime and is included in recent Windows 11 builds.

**Windows SmartScreen or my antivirus warns about the program.**
The program is not signed, which triggers SmartScreen. Click **More info → Run anyway** if you downloaded it from the [official releases page](https://github.com/InstaloaderSharp/InstaloaderSharp/releases). You can also [build it yourself](Building-and-contributing#building-from-source).

**`'InstaloaderSharp.exe' is not recognized as an internal or external command`.**
The command prompt cannot find the program. Run it with its full path (`C:\Tools\InstaloaderSharp.exe instagram`), change to its folder first, or add its folder to your `PATH`.

**Unable to initialize WinHTTP, or HTTP/2 errors.**
The program needs Windows 10 version 1607 or later. Check that Windows is up to date.

## Logging in

**The password is not accepted, although it is correct.**
Make sure you give your username, not your e-mail address or phone number, to `--login`. If Instagram refuses the login anyway (`Login error: "fail" status ...`, `Checkpoint required`), log in to instagram.com in Firefox and use `--load-cookies firefox`; see [Logging in](Logging-in#importing-the-login-from-your-web-browser).

**`Checkpoint required. Point your browser to ...`**
Instagram wants to confirm that it is you. Open the link in a browser where you are logged in to the same account, follow the instructions, and run the command again. Or use `--load-cookies`.

**`--load-cookies chrome` finds no cookies, or reads them but is not logged in.**
Recent Chrome versions encrypt cookies so that only Chrome can read them. Use Firefox (or LibreWolf) for logging in to Instagram, and `--load-cookies firefox`. For other Chromium-based browsers, close the browser before importing.

**It imports the wrong account.**
`--load-cookies` uses the account that is logged in in the browser's default profile. Log in with the right account in the browser, or use `--cookiefile` for another browser profile. The program prints which account it logged in as.

**The session stopped working.**
Sessions end when you log out in the browser you imported them from, change your password, or Instagram ends them. Log in again with `--login` (you are asked for the password) or import fresh cookies with `--load-cookies`.

**Two-factor authentication does not work.**
Instagram's two-factor login for programs is unreliable. Use `--load-cookies` instead.

## Rate limits and blocks

**`Too many queries in the last time. Need to wait ...`**
The program is pacing its requests to stay within Instagram's limits. This is normal for large downloads; it continues by itself. See [Rate limits and connections](Rate-limits-and-connections).

**`429 - Too Many Requests` or `Please wait a few minutes before you try again.` (401)**
Instagram limited the account or the connection. The program waits and retries. If it keeps happening:

- Do not run several downloads at the same time, and do not use the account heavily in the app or browser meanwhile.
- Stop for a while: hours rather than minutes.
- Use the account normally in a browser for a bit, then import fresh cookies with `--load-cookies`. A saved session that is throttled can stay throttled long after freshly imported cookies work again.
- Use a secondary account for downloading.

**`Download aborted: ... feedback_required` or `challenge_required`.**
Instagram has restricted the account and wants you to confirm something. Open Instagram in a browser or the app with that account and follow the instructions there. Then continue; resume information was saved.

**`Instagram keeps redirecting ...` or endless `HTTP redirect from ... to https://www.instagram.com/` lines.**
Instagram redirects every request of the account, usually because it is suspended, restricted or logged out. Open Instagram in a web browser with that account and follow the instructions there; a suspended account may have to be appealed. Older versions of InstaloaderSharp, like Instaloader, follow these redirects forever; press Ctrl+C to stop them.

**`Login required` or `Redirected to login page` while not logged in.**
Instagram refuses more and more requests without login. Log in; see [Logging in](Logging-in).

**`HTTP redirect from https://www.instagram.com/graphql/query to https://www.instagram.com/` and no posts are downloaded.**
This happens with Instaloader, and with older versions of InstaloaderSharp, when Instagram demands that queries look like its website's. Update to the [latest version](https://github.com/InstaloaderSharp/InstaloaderSharp/releases) of InstaloaderSharp. If it happens with the latest version, your session may be invalid: import fresh cookies with `--load-cookies`.

## Profiles and posts

**`Profile ... does not exist.`**
Check the spelling: usernames contain only letters, digits, `.` and `_`. The profile may have been renamed (if you downloaded it before, the program finds it by its ID), deleted, or it may have blocked your account; logged in, the program then tries again without logging in. Restricted profiles, for example age-restricted ones, are only shown to logged-in users: log in to download them.

**`JSON Query to web/search/topsearch/: 404 Not Found` and `api/v1/users/.../info/: 429 Too Many Requests`.**
An older version of InstaloaderSharp could not find restricted profiles, and fell back to lookups that Instagram has retired or refuses. Update to the [latest version](https://github.com/InstaloaderSharp/InstaloaderSharp/releases).

**`Login required.` or `Private but not followed.`**
The profile is private. You need to be logged in with an account that follows it.

**Posts are missing, or the download fails, without login.**
Instagram limits more and more what it shows to visitors who are not logged in, and may refuse the requests for a profile's posts. Log in to get all posts.

**The pictures have a low resolution.**
Log in. Logged in, the program gets the largest versions from Instagram's app interface, unless you gave `--no-iphone`.

**A single post: `unrecognized arguments: -DdwalmrkTSK`.**
Put `--` in front of the shortcode, after all options: `InstaloaderSharp.exe --no-videos -- -DdwalmrkTSK`.

**A hashtag is not downloaded, or `Invalid hashtag`.**
Put the hashtag in double quotes (`"#sunset"`), log in, and use only letters, digits and `_`.

**Downloading from an old metadata file fails with `403 Forbidden`.**
The download links in the file have expired. Download the post by its shortcode instead.

## Stories, highlights, feed and saved posts

**`--stories` downloads nothing.**
Stories need a login, and only exist for 24 hours. The profile may have no current story, or you may not be allowed to see it (private profile, close friends).

**`--reels` fails with `InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'InstaloaderSharp.Json.JValue' to type 'InstaloaderSharp.Json.JObject'`.**
An older version of InstaloaderSharp used a reels query that Instagram no longer answers. Update to the [latest version](https://github.com/InstaloaderSharp/InstaloaderSharp/releases).

**`Instagram's response to the reels query contains no reels.`**
Instagram has changed its reels query again. Check for a newer version, or [report it](Building-and-contributing#reporting-bugs). The rest of the download continues.

**Story download fails with an error about a property.**
`--filename-pattern` is used for story items too. A placeholder that only posts have, such as `{likes}`, fails for story items. Use placeholders both have, such as `{date_utc}` and `{shortcode}`.

**`:feed` never ends.**
Your feed is practically endless. Use `--count`, or `--fast-update` to stop at the first post you already have.

**Where are the stories of `:stories`?**
In the folder `：stories` (with a full-width colon), in the current directory.

## Files and folders

**Folders have strange names like `：feed`.**
Windows does not allow `:` in names, so it is replaced with the similar-looking full-width colon `：`. The same is done for other characters that Windows does not allow; see [File and folder names](File-and-folder-names#invalid-characters).

**Files are saved in the wrong place, or in `C:\Windows\System32`.**
Downloads go to the current directory of the command prompt. In scheduled tasks, change to the right folder first (`cd /d D:\Instagram`) or use an absolute `--dirname-pattern`.

**The dates in Windows Explorer are not the download dates.**
That is intended: each file's modification time is the time the post was published, so sorting by date sorts by posting time.

**How do I open `.json.xz` files?**
They are compressed JSON. Open them with [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), or use `--no-compress-json` to get plain `.json` files. See [Downloaded files](Downloaded-files#metadata-files).

**`..._old_01.txt` files appear.**
The owner changed the post's caption; the old caption is kept. See [Downloaded files](Downloaded-files#captions).

**Paths that are too long.**
Windows limits paths to 260 characters unless long paths are enabled. Enable them (in **Local Group Policy Editor → Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → System → Filesystem → Enable Win32 long paths**, or with the registry value `LongPathsEnabled`), or use shorter templates and folder names.

**`.temp` files are left behind.**
The program was stopped while downloading. The next download replaces them. You can delete them.

## Updates and resuming

**`--fast-update` stops too early.**
It stops at the first post that exists already. If you changed `--filename-pattern` or `--dirname-pattern`, the existing files are not found under the new names. Pinned posts at the top of a profile are handled. Without `--fast-update`, all posts are checked.

**`--fast-update` downloads everything again.**
The files are not where the current templates expect them; for example, you moved the folder or changed the patterns. Use `--latest-stamps` if you move downloaded files.

**`--latest-stamps` downloads everything again.**
The time in the stamps file could not be read; it must have exactly the format `2026-10-01T00:00:00.000000+0000`. Or the profile's section name differs from the username you gave. See [Keeping an archive up to date](Keeping-an-archive-up-to-date#latest-stamps).

**`--latest-stamps profilename` complains about a file or downloads nothing.**
`--latest-stamps` takes an optional file name, and took `profilename` as the file name. Write `--latest-stamps -- profilename`, or give the file name.

**A download does not resume.**
Resume files exist only for some kinds of lists (see [Interrupting and resuming](Interrupting-and-resuming#what-can-be-resumed)), are only used by the same target with the same login, and expire after 29 days.

## Filters and templates

**`Invalid filter: ... not a Post attribute.`**
A name in the filter is not a property. Check the spelling against the [Properties reference](Properties-reference). Functions such as `len()` are not available.

**`Invalid filter: invalid syntax`.**
The expression is not valid Python syntax. Check the quotes: double quotes around the whole filter, single quotes inside.

**`Filter evaluation failed` for some posts.**
The filter uses a property that some posts do not have, for example `video_duration` for pictures. Add a check: `video_duration is not None and video_duration > 60`.

**`can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`.**
`date_local` has a time zone and cannot be compared with `datetime(...)`. Use `date_utc`, or `datetime(...).astimezone()`.

## General questions

**Can I download private profiles that I do not follow?**
No. InstaloaderSharp only downloads what your account can see on Instagram.

**Can InstaloaderSharp like, follow, comment or post?**
No. It only reads from Instagram.

**Does it work on Linux or macOS?**
No, it is a Windows program. Use [Instaloader](https://github.com/instaloader/instaloader) there; it uses the same files and commands.

**Is there a graphical interface?**
Yes, [InstaloaderSharp GUI](https://github.com/InstaloaderSharp/InstaloaderSharpGUI).

**Do I need Python?**
No. InstaloaderSharp is a single .NET program.

## Getting help

1. Check the version (`InstaloaderSharp.exe --version`) and update to the [latest release](https://github.com/InstaloaderSharp/InstaloaderSharp/releases): many problems are caused by changes on Instagram's side and are fixed in newer versions.
2. Search the [issues](https://github.com/InstaloaderSharp/InstaloaderSharp/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for the error message.
3. Open a new issue with the command, the complete output and the version. Never post passwords, session files or cookies. See [Building and contributing](Building-and-contributing#reporting-bugs).
